# Claude Code Rules — Agency Toolkit

## End-of-Session Checklist (MANDATORY)

Before completing any coding session, ALWAYS do the following in order:

### 1. Run Quality Checks
```bash
npm run lint
npm run build
```
If either fails, fix the issues before proceeding.

### 2. Update SESSION_LOG.md
Append a new entry at the top of SESSION_LOG.md (below the header) using this format:

```markdown
## [TODAY'S DATE] — [CURRENT TIME]

**Duration:** [approximate time spent]

### What I did
- (list completed tasks)

### What's next
- (immediate next steps for this project)

### Blockers
- (anything preventing progress, or "None")

### Cross-project notes
- (anything that affects other projects: shared component changes,
   pattern decisions, etc. Or "None")
```

### 3. Commit
Stage and commit all changes including the session log update.

## General Rules

- Read CLAUDE.md at the start of every session for project context
- Read the last SESSION_LOG.md entry to understand where we left off
- Do not leave the repo with failing lint or build
- Do not modify files outside this project's directory
- If you identify a pattern that should be shared across projects, note it in the cross-project section of the session log
